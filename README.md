# Tea Cup Tinker Board

![logo](https://github.com/HackerHomestead/teacup/blob/main/Artwork/TeaCupBanner.png)

The *Tea Cup* is a Tinker Board built on the *Ingenic T31* MIPS CPU, which is
specialised for Video & Audio Applications, and has highly integrated support
for multiple interfaces, LCD's, SD Card, Ethernet and more.

Designed with the community in mind, the *Tea Cup* is going to be ideal for
Kids, Tweens and Teens, and adults alike, to tinker with hardware and software
inside of an interface designed with ease-of-use and simplicity, but never 
locking the user down to a limited API or enviroment.


This project is currently in alpha, with a small team working on it, you can

Having this in mind, the tools we are using in this project are:
* FreeCAD
* KiCad
* binwalk
* Ghidra
* GIMP

## Currently Working on:
* Getting an up-to-date SDK from ingenic
* Compiling uboot and attempting to create our own kernel with outdated SDK
* PCB Design for REV-A
* Testing differences between T31 Series and other Ingenic CPUs
* Finding a reliable and cheap method to get ICs from existing products
* Getting source for bulk order of T31's

## Have finished:
* REV-A Roadmap
* Compiled and ran code on the host device
* Reverse engineering of the "$1 webcam" PCB, with full Serial comms
