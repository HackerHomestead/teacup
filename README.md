# Tea Cup Tinker Board

![logo](https://github.com/HackerHomestead/teacup/blob/main/Artwork/TeaCupBanner.png)

The *Tea Cup* is a Tinker Board built on the *Ingenic T31* MIPS CPU, which is
specialised for Video & Audio Applications, and has highly integrated support
for multiple interfaces, LCD's, SD Card, Ethernet and more.

Designed with the community in mind, the *Tea Cup* is going to be ideal for
Kids, Tweens and Teens, and adults alike, to tinker with hardware and software
inside of an interface designed with ease-of-use and simplicity, but never 
locking the user down to a limited API or enviroment.
