# mips64aws

A few tools and programs written in C and C++ using a MIPSel 64bit AWS host,
using compiler flgas to change the mabi and arch (see compile-for-t31.sh).

These were confirmed to work on a T31 and T21 based webcam running Linux, but
required static linking due to out of date libs on the webcam, as such the 
file sizes are bloated beyond normal sizes.
